# 0x1E. C - Search Algorithms

## Introduction

Search algorithms are fundamental techniques in computer science used to find specific elements or values within data structures such as arrays, lists, trees, or graphs. These algorithms play a crucial role in various applications, including information retrieval, data processing, and problem-solving.

### Linear search

Linear search, also known as sequential search, is a simple and straightforward searching algorithm used to find a specific element in a list or array. It works by iterating through each element in the list until the target element is found or the end of the list is reached.
